Just add an "order again" button in Recent Orders list

== Description ==

Would your customers like to repeat their order and place it in their shopping cart again? WooCommerce has provided an option for this in WooCommerce Core. The button is only displayed in the detail page of the order and if the order have the status "completed" in the customers account.

With our extension you can integrate and display the button "re-order", "repeat order" on the overview page. This is especially useful when complex shopping cart contents are needed again and again, for example by resellers or in the B2B sector. Customers can place the goods they have already ordered in the shopping basket directly from the overview page.

In addition, we have provided additional features for our expansion:

* 	Activation of "Order note" with a reference to the original order.
	The shop manager thus has the information from which completed order the new order was triggered.

* 	Activation of the standard button "Re-order" of WooCommerce, if you use WooCommerce Germanized version 2.0.4 or older, or
	another plugin or theme suppresses the button "Re-order". Then activate this option to reactivate the button.
