Digital Currency Payment Gateway for WooCommerce. Easily accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and more in your store.

== Description ==
Our Cryptocurrency Payment Gateway was built with the core values of Cryptocurrency in mind with regards to anonymity and security. The plugin seamlessly enables your store to accept  Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and more, right away by simply adding your Wallet addresses.

The plugin was created to solve a solution that we and several merchants were facing, which was a gateway that respects customer privacy, no external redirects, seamless integration, has no middleman fees, and we achieved it. Over the years our plugin has been improved to also offer Zeroconf support enabling customers to instantly receive their products without risk to the merchant.

### Plugin Features:
