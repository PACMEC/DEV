Classic Elements is a hard fork of Elementor adopted to work with ClassicPress!

The most advanced frontend drag & drop page builder. Create high-end, pixel perfect websites at record speeds. Any theme, any page, any design.

## Description ##

It's about time for a live page builder, with no limits of design. A page builder that delivers high-end page designs and advanced capabilities, never before seen on ClassicPress.

It's time for **[Classic Elements Page Builder](https://classicelements.page/)**.

### Faster. Much faster. ###
Instant reaction was a key feature we wanted to achieve. And we did. Instant drag & drop page builder, instant live edit, instant page load. The speed of Classic Elements is not matched by any other page builder, free or paid. This makes the interface fun and easy to work with, as well as reduces the time it takes to design.

### Live design. Truly live. ###
Never again work on the backend and guess what the frontend will look like. With Classic Elements page builder, you edit the page and simultaneously see exactly how it looks like. Classic Elements features live design & inline editing, so the whole process of writing and designing is done directly on the page, with no need to press update or go to preview mode. It also works perfectly with or without Gutenberg.

### Surprises you wonâ€™t see anywhere else. ###
With Classic Elements's unique features, you can create websites that have that certain 'designer touch'. Among our page builder features are: Box Shadows, Background Overlays, Hover Effects, Headline Effects, Animations, Shape Dividers, Gradient Backgrounds and much more.

### Pre-Designed Templates & Blocks ###
Choose from a selection of beautiful full page [ClassicPress templates](https://library.classicelements.page/) and customize them to make them your own. You can also build your page by choosing from 300+ Blocks.

Blocks are pre-designed section templates that can be easily combined into any page. Blocks include a variety of categories: services, testimonials, call to action and more. Save and reuse Classic Elements templates on different pages, or export them to a different website with a click.

### Mobile First. Mobile Editing. ###
Classic Elements Page Builder comes with an exclusive toolset, that lets you create truly a responsive website in a whole new and visual way. From different font size, padding and margin per device, to reverse column ordering, this is the most powerful mobile page builder for creating perfect responsive websites.

### Undo / Redo & Revision History. ###
Our page builder includes undo and redo for any action you make. Click on Ctrl / Cmd + Z, or browse through the complete list of actions. Want to go back ever further? Switch to Revisions to view a complete list of all earlier saved versions of the page.

### Canvas. A Blank Page Template for Landing Pages. ###
Design your entire page in the page builder. No header, no footer, just Classic Elements. This is perfect for landing pages and coming soon pages. Canvas works on any theme, and lets you get rid of the header area so you get a blank template to work on.

### Built-in Maintenance Mode & Under Construction. ###
Need to get your site offline for maintenance? Use Classic Elements page builder's built in Maintenance Mode & Coming Soon feature to show your visitors an under construction / coming soon page.
